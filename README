SB.litmus is the litmus test generated by diy7
bin/ is the directory created by `litmus7 SB.litmus -o bin/`
inside bin/ is SB.exe, which is the compiled test executable (x86)

If you run SB.exe it'll run the test locally and collect the results for you to see, and you'll get something like:
> Test SB Allowed
> Histogram (4 states)
> 9     *>0:EAX=0; 1:EAX=0;
> 499981:>0:EAX=1; 1:EAX=0;
> 499999:>0:EAX=0; 1:EAX=1;
> 11    :>0:EAX=1; 1:EAX=1;

> Positive: 9, Negative: 999991
> Condition exists (0:EAX=0 /\ 1:EAX=0) is validated
> Hash=7dbd6b8e6dd4abc2ef3d48b0376fb2e3
> Observation SB Sometimes 9 999991
> Time SB 0.18

This says that there were 9 occurrences of the "relaxed" behaviour and the test lasted 0.18 seconds.
